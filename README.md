# Widget
An open source one-line installation web accessibility widget.


I've been passionate about web access ibility since I learned web development. But when I went looking for an accessibility widget for my site to provide additional accessibility features, I found that all of them were paid subscription. While they did provide features like Accessibility Audits, Analytics and AI to identify and apply fixes on the fly, I could not find a comprehensive free solution.

So this project's is to provide exactly that: a comprehensive, free solution. It probably won't have AI anytime soon, but there are no subscriptions, no ads, and no tracking, forever.
